# 🚗 Ride-Hub – Multi-Vehicle Rural & Urban Ride-Booking Application

A smart, inclusive transportation platform with AI chatbot support.

# ⭐ Overview

Ride-Hub is a modern ride-booking application designed to support both rural and urban mobility needs. Unlike traditional ride apps that support only taxis, autos, or bikes, Ride-Hub includes 17 different vehicle types, such as tractors, tempos, vans, goods carriers, private cars, buses, and more—making it one of the most inclusive mobility platforms.

The system includes Google Maps–based navigation, an AI-powered chatbot, and a fully functional Admin Dashboard for managing users, drivers, vehicles, and trip-related operations.

Ride-Hub also introduces a fully online earning ecosystem for drivers, helping them receive digital ride requests without depending on offline passenger searching.
